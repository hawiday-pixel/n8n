# n8n API Operations

## Important Concepts

- **n8n has no folders** — workflows are a flat list in n8n
- **Local folders** (`dev/`, `prod/`, `admin/`, etc.) are for local organization only
- **Workflows are matched by `"name"` field** — changing the name creates a new workflow, not an update
- **Single n8n instance** — dev `[DEV]` and prod workflows coexist independently

## API Access

n8n MCP tools are configured and available. No scripts needed — use MCP tools directly through Cursor.

## MCP Tool Reference

| MCP Tool | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `n8n_list_workflows` | List all workflows (metadata only) |
| `n8n_get_workflow` | Get full workflow JSON by ID |
| `n8n_create_workflow` | Create new workflow in n8n |
| `n8n_update_full_workflow` | Update existing workflow (full replacement) |
| `n8n_update_partial_workflow` | Incremental updates (rename, activate, add nodes) |
| `n8n_delete_workflow` | Delete workflow (requires user confirmation) |
| `n8n_validate_workflow` | Validate workflow by ID |
| `n8n_autofix_workflow` | Auto-fix common validation errors |

## Five Types of Work

### 1. Create New Dev Workflow
- Start all new workflows in `workflows/dev/`
- Follow naming conventions in `workflow-naming.mdc`
- Filename: `{company}-{short-description}.json`
- Workflow name (JSON): `{COMPANY} | {Category} | {short-description} [DEV]`
- Set `"active": false`
- Deploy with: `n8n_create_workflow` MCP tool

### 2. Amend/Edit Existing Workflow
- **Export first** to get the latest version from n8n using `n8n_get_workflow`
- Edit the existing JSON file in place
- **Do NOT create a new file** — modify the existing one
- **Do NOT change the `"name"` field** — this will create a duplicate!
- Deploy changes with `n8n_update_full_workflow` MCP tool

### 3. Promote Dev to Prod
When dev workflow is stable and tested:
1. Copy file from `dev/` to `prod/`
2. Remove `[DEV]` from the `"name"` field
3. Remove or update `"id"` field
4. Update credentials to production
5. Set `"active": true`
6. Deploy with `n8n_create_workflow`

### 4. Rename Workflow
- **Do NOT change `"name"` in local JSON** — import will create duplicate
- Use `n8n_update_partial_workflow` with `updateName` operation
- After renaming in n8n, update local JSON filename to match

### 5. Delete Workflow
- **ALWAYS ask for explicit user approval before deleting**
- Use `n8n_delete_workflow` MCP tool
- Never delete without confirmation

## Common Operations

### Export a workflow
```
Ask Cursor: "Export workflow ID xyz to workflows/dev/admin/"
→ Uses n8n_get_workflow, writes to local file
```

### Deploy a dev workflow
```
Ask Cursor: "Deploy workflows/dev/admin/tner-email-classifier.json to n8n"
→ Reads local file, uses n8n_create_workflow or n8n_update_full_workflow
```

### Promote to production
```
Ask Cursor: "Promote tner-email-classifier from dev to prod"
→ Copies file, removes [DEV], updates settings, deploys
```

### Rename a workflow
```
Ask Cursor: "Rename workflow 'OLD NAME' to 'NEW NAME'"
→ Uses n8n_update_partial_workflow with updateName operation
```

### Activate/Deactivate
```
Ask Cursor: "Activate workflow ID xyz"
→ Uses n8n_update_partial_workflow with activateWorkflow operation
```

## Rules

- **Do not ask for API credentials** — MCP tools are pre-configured
- **Never change `"name"` field directly in JSON** — use MCP rename instead
- **Start all new workflows in dev/** — never create directly in prod/
- **Test thoroughly before promoting** — prod should only have stable workflows
- Match existing workflows by the `"name"` field in JSON
- Use `n8n_health_check` to verify API connectivity if issues occur
